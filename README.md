# Is This True?

`Is This True?` helps you quickly fact-check text and images you see online.

It is built for people who want a fast, readable answer with source-backed context, not just a one-line AI opinion.
**Is This True? is built to do more than produce a quick AI guess.**  
It runs a structured, multi-step verification process designed to evaluate claims from multiple perspectives and ground conclusions in current, real-world sources.

## What You Can Do

- Highlight a claim on any webpage and check it instantly.
- Right-click an image, meme, or infographic to analyze it.
- See a clear verdict:
  - `TRUE`
  - `FALSE`
  - `PARTIALLY TRUE`
  - `UNVERIFIABLE`
- Review confidence, summary, and deeper reasoning in one panel.

## How It Works

When you run a check, the extension:

1. Analyzes the claim or image content.
2. Cross-checks with real-time web information.
3. Compares evidence from multiple sources.
4. Returns a structured result with reasoning and references.

For political or controversial claims, it is designed to surface multiple viewpoints so results are not one-sided.

## Why People Use It

- Saves time when claims are vague, emotional, or fast-moving.
- Makes it easier to spot missing context and misleading framing.
- Shows reasoning and sources so you can judge the result yourself.
- Works directly on the page you are already reading.

## Accuracy and Limitations

`Is This True?` is designed for high reliability, but no automated checker is perfect.

- Treat results as decision support, not absolute truth.
- For high-stakes decisions (health, legal, financial, safety), always verify with primary sources and qualified experts.
- Breaking news and developing events can change quickly, which may affect outcomes.
