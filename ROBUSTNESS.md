# How Robust Is the Analysis?

**Is This True? is built to do more than produce a quick AI guess.**  
It runs a structured, multi-step verification process designed to evaluate claims from multiple perspectives and ground conclusions in current, real-world sources.

When a user submits text or an image, the system:

- **Breaks down the claim into distinct checkable parts** so multi-claim statements are not oversimplified.
- **Performs real-time web verification** to prioritize current evidence over stale model memory.
- **Cross-references diverse source perspectives** (including left, center, and right-leaning outlets for political claims) to reduce one-sided conclusions.
- **Weights evidence quality and recency** so primary records, reputable reporting, and up-to-date information carry more influence.
- **Returns structured outputs** including verdict, confidence, reasoning, and source transparency, so users can inspect *why* a conclusion was reached.
- **Flags uncertainty explicitly** when evidence is weak, conflicting, or incomplete, rather than forcing overconfident answers.

For controversial or political topics, the system is specifically designed to surface **multiple viewpoints fairly**, helping users understand where consensus exists and where interpretations diverge.

## What this means in practice

The goal is **high-integrity verification**: fast, transparent, and balanced.  
Instead of pretending every claim can be judged with perfect certainty, Is This True? emphasizes evidence quality, source diversity, and explainable reasoning to deliver dependable results you can actually scrutinize.

## Accuracy statement (recommended wording)

Is This True? is designed for high reliability, but no automated system is infallible. Results should be treated as a decision-support layer and independently verified for high-stakes use.
