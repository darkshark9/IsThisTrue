# Installing Is This True? on Mac

The app is built with ad-hoc signing (no Apple Developer account), so no Terminal commands are needed. Follow these steps after installing from the DMG.

## 1. Install from the DMG

- Open the DMG and drag **Is This True?** to your **Applications** folder.

## 2. Open the app

- Double-click **Is This True?** in Applications.
- The first time only, macOS may show **"Is This True?" cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.** Then:
  - **Right-click** (or Control-click) the app
  - Choose **Open**
  - In the dialog, click **Open** again  

After that, the app will open normally from the dock or Spotlight.

## 3. Screen recording permission (for snipping)

When you first use **Snip region** (Cmd+Shift+F9) or **Snip Region** from the menu bar menu, macOS may prompt for **Screen Recording** access. If it doesn’t, and capture doesn’t work:

1. Open **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Screen Recording**
2. Turn on **Is This True?**
3. Restart the app if needed

This is a one-time permission; you won’t be asked again unless you revoke it.

You do not need Xcode, Apple Developer membership, or code signing to install or use the app.
